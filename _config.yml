  # 个人简介  
  intro: | 
    I am a Professor at the School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, supervising Ph.D. and master’s students. 
    My research focuses on computer vision, multimodal learning, medical image processing, and domain-specific applications of large models. 
    I have extensive experience in object detection, industrial defect detection, image segmentation, image enhancement, multimodal medical intelligent diagnosis, and the application of large models in real-world scenarios.
